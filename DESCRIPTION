Description: DNAnexus provides Trusted Research Environments (TREs) for several 
    large population-based cohort studies, like the UK Biobank (UKB) and 
    Our Future Health (OFH). For working on and with their TRE, they provide
    the `dx` Python utility for interacting with cloud environment. 
    When working within R, this requires switching to a 
    shell or wrapping calls in `system2()` or similar. This package provides
    several convenience wrappers to do this for you. Additionally, it enables
    submitting jobs with arbitrary R codes from your local session. Finally,
    several default workflows for OFH are provided.
