# OFHelper

This is a collection of helper functions and utilities to make working on the [Our Future Health TRE](https://ourfuturehealth.dnanexus.com/) more convenient.

## Installation

# TODO

* Launch jupyter
* use `https://github.com/dnanexus/dx-toolkit/tree/master/src/R`?
* Fix DD to have correct type before decoding (clean_data_dict(na_meaning = TRUE, decoded_column_types))
