\title{Decode Single-Select Variables}
\usage{
decode_single_select(variable, code, meaning)
}
\arguments{
\item{variable}{Character vector of coded values to be decoded}

\item{code}{Character vector of coded values for mapping}

\item{meaning}{Character vector of corresponding decoded meanings}
}
\value{
Character vector with decoded values. Mapped values are replaced
  with their meanings, unmapped values are preserved as-is.
}
\description{
Decodes single-select coded variables by mapping coded values to their
corresponding meanings.
}
\details{
This function performs exact matching of coded values against a lookup table
and replaces coded values with their decoded meanings. Values that don't
match any code are preserved as-is.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create mapping
codes <- c("A1", "B2", "C3")
meanings <- c("Option A", "Option B", "Option C")

# Decode single-select variables
# decoded <- decode_single_select(
#   variable = c("A1", "B2", "A1", "UNKNOWN"),
#   code = codes,
#   meaning = meanings
# )
# Result: c("Option A", "Option B", "Option A", "UNKNOWN")
}
