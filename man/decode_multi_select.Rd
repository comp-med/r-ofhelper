\title{Decode Multi-Select Variables}
\usage{
decode_multi_select(x, code, meaning)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Character vector of multi-select coded values. Each element should
be in the format "[CODE1,CODE2]" or "[CODE1|CODE2]"}

\item{code}{Character vector of coded values for mapping}

\item{meaning}{Character vector of corresponding decoded meanings}
}
\value{
Character vector with decoded values. Multi-select values maintain
  bracketed format with decoded meanings separated by pipes.
}
\description{
Decodes multi-select coded variables by mapping coded values to their
corresponding meanings within bracketed strings.
}
\details{
This function processes multi-select data where each observation may contain
multiple coded values separated by commas or pipes within brackets. It
replaces coded values with their decoded meanings while preserving the
multi-select structure. All separators are normalized to pipes for downstream
uniformity.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create mapping
codes <- c("A1", "B2", "C3")
meanings <- c("Option A", "Option B", "Option C")

# Decode multi-select variables
# decoded <- decode_multi_select(
#   x = c("[A1,B2]", "[C3]", "[A1|B2|C3]"),
#   code = codes,
#   meaning = meanings
# )
# Result: c("[Option A|Option B]", "[Option C]", "[Option A|Option B|Option C]")
}
