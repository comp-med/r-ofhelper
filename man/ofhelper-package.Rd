\title{ofhelper: Working with and on DNAnexus's Our Future Health Trusted Research Environment}
\description{
DNAnexus provides Trusted Research Environments (TREs) for several large population-based cohort studies, like the UK Biobank (UKB) and Our Future Health (OFH). For working on and with their TRE, they provide the `dx` Python utility for interacting with cloud environment. When working within R, this requires switching to a shell or wrapping calls in `system2()` or similar. This package provides several convenience wrappers to do this for you. Additionally, it enables submitting jobs with arbitrary R codes from your local session. Finally, several default workflows for OFH are provided.
