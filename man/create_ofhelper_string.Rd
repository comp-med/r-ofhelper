\title{Create Complete ofhelper Package Source String}
\usage{
create_ofhelper_string()
}
\value{
Character string containing the complete source code of all ofhelper
  R scripts concatenated together
}
\description{
Creates a complete concatenated string of all ofhelper package R script files.
This function is specifically designed for environments like the Our Future Health
TRE where external packages cannot be installed, allowing the complete package
source to be embedded directly into command executions.
}
\details{
The function reads all R scripts from the ofhelper package and combines them
into a single string that can be included in command inputs, eliminating the
need for package installation in restricted environments.
